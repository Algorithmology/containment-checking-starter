TODO: Make sure that you remove all the markers in this file that serve a
prompts for work that you have not yet completed. The final version of this
report should be written as if it was a scientific report that you could publish
on the Algorithmology web site or in a scientific journal.

## Gregory M. Kapfhammer

## Re-type the sentence "I adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code while completing this project."

TODO: You must retype the sentence here in order to digitally sign your pledge.

"I adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code while completing this project."

**IMPORTANT:** If you do not type the required sentence then the course
instructor will not know that you adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code
while completing the project.

TODO: Please list here the sources that you consulted while completing the
algorithm engineering project. The list of sources should also include
references to any artificial intelligence coding assistants that you used and a
summary of the ways in which you used those coding assistants to complete this
project. You can use a Markdown list to provide and comment on the sources.

## Program Output

### Report at least two examples of program output from when you can the `systemsense` program

TODO: The request for providing output from this program is intended to ensure
that you provide details for the execution environment, thereby contextualizing
the performance results presented in this report. You should provide one output
of this program from running on your laptop and one from GitHub Actions.

#### First output from running the `systemsense` program

```text
output
```

#### Second output from running the `systemsense` program

```text
output
```

### Report at least five examples of program output to demonstrate that your `containmentcheck` program works correctly

TODO: Document and justify your choice for all the experiment parameters

#### First output from running the `containmentcheck` program

TODO: Provide the command-line used to run the `containmentcheck` program
TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the output from running `containmentcheck`

#### Second output from running the `containmentcheck` program

TODO: Provide the command-line used to run the `containmentcheck` program
TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the output from running `containmentcheck`

#### Third output from running the `containmentcheck` program

TODO: Provide the command-line used to run the `containmentcheck` program
TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the output from running `containmentcheck`

#### Fourth output from running the `containmentcheck` program

TODO: Provide the command-line used to run the `containmentcheck` program
TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the output from running `containmentcheck`

#### Fifth output from running the `containmentcheck` program

TODO: Provide the command-line used to run the `containmentcheck` program
TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the output from running `containmentcheck`

## Experiment Design

TODO: Explain the setup for your experiment that you plan to run to
characterize the performance of the different configurations of containment
checking algorithms. Remember, a containment check determines whether or not a
specified value exists inside of some type of data container! For instance, you
should consider the following parameters as a part of your experiment:

- The data container: `set`, `list`, and `tuple`
- The size of the data container: small values (e.g., 1 million numbers) to big
  values (e.g., 32 million numbers)
- Whether or not the value that it being searched for is in the list
- The maximum value of the numbers that are inside of the data container

TODO: You must justify every part of your experiment design and then furnish
output examples to demonstrate that your program generates correct data! Note
that the output samples should appear in the prior section of this report.

## Research Questions

TODO: Clearly state at least three research questions that you want to ask and
answer by using the `containmentcheck` program. You should provide the research
questions in a list that starts with "RQ" and ends with a question mark.

TODO: Do not write and conduct experiments to answer a specific research
question until you have met with the course instructor and received feedback and
approval for your research questions and experiment designs.

## Data Tables

TODO: Use Markdown to provide one or more data tables that summarize the results
from running the `containmentcheck` program in different configurations. You
should provide enough data tables and output values to ensure that you can
answer all of your research questions through the use of empirical results.

## Performance Analysis

TODO: Provide at least three paragraphs that explain which containment checking
algorithm is fastest, by how much it is faster, and how you knew that it was
faster, referencing the data in the aforementioned command outputs and the data
tables to support your response. You should make sure that you answer each of
the at least three research questions that you posed in a previous section.

TODO: Make sure that your responses explain WHY certain configurations are faster!
TODO: It is not sufficient to ONLY explain WHICH configuration is faster!

## Source Code

### Pick a segment of source code in `containmentcheck` and describe in detail how it works

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the chosen source code
TODO: Write at least one paragraph to explain the request source code
TODO: Use your own words to explain the provided source code

### Describe in detail how the `containmentcheck` program is organized into modules

TODO: This question is asking you to investigate the separate Python files that
make up the `containmentcheck` program and explain how they are organized.

## Professional Development

### What is challenging about designing an experiment to evaluate a collection's performance?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response that answers this question in your own words.

### How do the empirical results suggest that you don't yet know the entire story about the performance of containment checking?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response that answers this question in your own words.

### Using the empirical results what is one aspect of containment checking's performance about which you are confident?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response that answers this question in your own words.

### Take Home Points

TODO: Provide a two to three sentence statement about the key takeaways from
conducting this experiment. Please note that the course instructor will display
some student takeaways on the course web site and use them to facilitate
follow-on class discussions.
