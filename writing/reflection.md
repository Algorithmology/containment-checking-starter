## Add Your Name Here

## Re-type the sentence "I adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code while completing this project."

TODO: You must retype the sentence here in order to digitally sign your pledge.

**IMPORTANT:** If you do not type the required sentence then the course
instructor will not know that you adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code
while completing the project.

## Program Output

### Report at least two examples of program output from when you can the `systemsense` program

#### First output from running the `systemsense` program

TODO: Add program output in a fenced code block.

#### Second output from running the `systemsense` program

TODO: Add program output in a fenced code block.

### Report at least five examples of program output to demonstrate that your `containmentcheck` program works correctly

TODO: Document and justify your choice for all of the experiment parameters

#### First output from running the `containmentcheck` program

TODO: Add program output in a fenced code block.

#### Second output from running the `containmentcheck` program

TODO: Add program output in a fenced code block.

#### Third output from running the `containmentcheck` program

TODO: Add program output in a fenced code block.

#### Fourth output from running the `containmentcheck` program

TODO: Add program output in a fenced code block.

#### Fifth output from running the `containmentcheck` program

TODO: Add program output in a fenced code block.

## Experiment Design

TODO: Explain the setup for your experiment that you plan to run to
characterize the performance of the different configurations of containment
checking algorithms. Remember, a containment check determines whether or not a
specified value exists inside of some type of data container! For instance, you
should consider the following parameters as a part of your experiment:

- The data container: `set`, `list`, and `tuple`
- The size of the data container: small values (e.g., 1 million numbers) to big
  values (e.g., 32 million numbers)
- Whether or not the value that it being searched for is in the list
- The maximum value of the numbers that are inside of the data container

TODO: You must justify every part of your experiment design and then furnish
output examples to demonstrate that your program generates correct data!

TODO: You must meet in person with the course instructor to discuss the design
of your experiment before you conduct the experiment itself.

## Research Questions

TODO: Clearly state at least three research questions that you want to ask and
answer by using the `containmentcheck` program. You should provide the research
questions in a list that starts with "RQ" and ends with a question mark. Please
see the engineering effort about the intersection algorithms for examples of
research questions that the course instructor created for that project.

TODO: You must meet in person with the course instructor to discuss the research
questions before you conduct the experiment itself.

## Data Tables

TODO: Use Markdown to provide one or more data tables that summarize the results
from running the `containmentcheck` program in different configurations. You
should provide enough data tables and output values to ensure that you can
answer all of your research questions and use the empirical results to classify
the likely worst-case time complexity of each of the algorithms.

TODO: You must meet in person with the course instructor to discuss the analysis
of your data before you submit the final version of your assignment.

## Performance Analysis

TODO: Provide at least three paragraphs that explain which containment checking
algorithm is fastest, by how much it is faster, and how you knew that it was
faster, referencing the data in the aforementioned command outputs and the data
tables to support your response. You should make sure that you answer each of
the at least three research questions that you posed in a previous section.

TODO: You must meet in person with the course instructor to discuss the analysis
of your data before you submit the final version of your assignment.

TODO: Make sure that your responses explain WHY certain configurations are faster!
TODO: It is not sufficient to ONLY explain WHICH configuration is faster!

## Source Code

### Pick a segment of source code in `containmentcheck` and describe in detail how it works

TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide the requested source code
TODO: Write at least one paragraph to explain the request source code

### Describe in detail how the `containmentcheck` program is organized into modules

## Professional Development

### What is challenging about designing an experiment to evaluate a collection's performance?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response that answers this question in your own words.

### How do the empirical results suggest that you don't yet know the entire story about the performance of containment checking?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response that answers this question in your own words.

### Take Home Points

TODO: Provide a two to three sentence statement about the key takeaways from
conducting this experiment. Please note that the course instructor will display
some student takeaways on the course web site and use them to facilitate
follow-on class discussions.
